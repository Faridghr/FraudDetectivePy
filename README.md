# FraudDetectivePy
Python-based supervised machine learning project developed as the final project for INFO 6105

## Overview
The goal of this project is twofold: first, to understand how an imbalanced dataset can impact the analysis and results of credit card fraud detection; and second, to evaluate the effectiveness of different classification models and techniques aimed at enhancing the accuracy and reliability of fraud detection systems.

## Key Objectives
- Understand the effects of imbalanced datasets on fraud detection analysis.
- Compare Undersampling and Oversampling techniques for addressing data imbalance.
- Benchmark the performance of different classification models.
- Address outliers and normalize features to refine analysis and predictions.

## Project Structure
- **dataset/**: Contains dataset used for the project.
- **src/**: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **report/**: Stores report files.
